2. Get user to input frame rate in order to subdivide audio
3. Subdivide audio in accordance to given frame rate
4. Play each subdivision of captured audio
5. Allow user to scroll through audio subdivisions
6. Allow user to play each division as many times as they would like
7. Display where in the clip the user is at

_**Optional Goals**_
1. Display audio wave
2. Display subdivisions over wave
3. Allow user to go to specific audio divisions 
4. Allow user to upload and play video clip (their animation) along with the audio to see how video lines up with audio
